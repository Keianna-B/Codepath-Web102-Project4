# Web Development Project 4 - Pokedex exploration

Submitted by: Keianna Brown

This web app: Pokemon can be sorted by their generation, types, abilities, and weight. All of those attributes can be added and removed from the ban list. Every time a pokemon is searched for it has a 5% chance to display the shiny sprite instead of the default sprite.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**

- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
  - [x] To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:
